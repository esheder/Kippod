// << condition.hpp >>
// This header is for a condition object. This is a set of conditions that defines a state a component/core is in. Some things are local (temperature might be local) and some things are global. Deal with it.
// Style is header-should-be-small



class Condition {
  // The correct way to do this is by creating maps of variables (global and local) and values.
  // Alas, there is no such map given in C++. We can create a de-facto one with internet help,
